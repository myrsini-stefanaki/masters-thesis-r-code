## About This Repository
This repository contains the R code and dataset used for my master's thesis, which examines how **publicity** and its relationship with **advertising uncertainty** affect **pre-release buzz** and **box office revenue** in the movie industry. 

The analysis includes:  
- **Data collection and cleaning** from online sources (Google Trends, YouTube, Reddit, IMDb).  
- **Correlation analysis** to explore theory-based relationships.

- **Visualizations** to highlight the results
- **Assumption testing** to verify the results
